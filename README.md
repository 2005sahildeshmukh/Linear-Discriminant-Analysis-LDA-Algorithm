# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-LDA-Algorithm
🧠 Project Description

This project implements the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm — a powerful technique used in machine learning and statistics for dimensionality reduction and classification.

LDA works by projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space in such a way that class separability is maximized. Unlike PCA, which focuses on maximizing variance without considering class labels, LDA explicitly uses class information to enhance discriminative power between categories.

Through this project, LDA is implemented step-by-step to:

Compute class means and the overall mean

Calculate within-class and between-class scatter matrices

Derive eigenvalues and eigenvectors to find optimal projection directions

Reduce dimensions while retaining the most relevant features for classification

This implementation helps in understanding how supervised dimensionality reduction techniques work and how LDA improves model interpretability and classification accuracy.
